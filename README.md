# Introduction:
Thank you for taking the time to allow me to showcase my projects and skills that I've acquired over the years through education and experience. Besides this project site I have a regular github website with some facts about me as well as my professional statement. I encourage you to take a couple minutes to review that as I am confident it will create, hopefully, a more personable connection. Thank you again for your time and consideration.
